      <strong>Parking and Maneuvers:</strong> Practice parallel parking, three-point turns, and other maneuvers that may be part of the test. Take your time and be precise.</li><br>

      <li><strong>After the Test:</strong><br>
      <strong>Stay Positive:</strong> Regardless of the outcome, stay positive. If you don’t pass, ask for feedback from the examiner to understand what you need to improve, and schedule another test.<br>
      <strong>Celebrate:</strong> If you pass, congratulations! Celebrate your achievement and remember to continue practicing safe driving habits.</li><br>
